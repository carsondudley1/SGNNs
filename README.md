## Overview

**Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs)** are a general framework for training neural networks on mechanistic simulations to perform forecasting, inference, regression, and classification in scientific domains. SGNNs enable robust, interpretable, and data-efficient learning even in noisy, low-resource, or unobservable settings. The approach has been validated across epidemiology, chemistry, ecology, and social science.

SGNNs unify mechanistic reasoning and deep learning by treating simulations as flexible supervisory signals‚Äîrather than fixed priors or surrogates‚Äîenabling both zero-shot generalization and mechanistic interpretability via *back-to-simulation attribution*.

## Getting Started

### Installation

This repo requires Python 3.10+ and PyTorch 2.0+.


### Running the Code

Clone the repo and run any of the notebooks (`.ipynb`) in Jupyter or VS Code. For example:

- Run `generation_v5_human.ipynb` to generate synthetic infectious disease data.
- Use `source_id.ipynb` to evaluate SGNNs on cascade source inference.
- Run `chem_yield_zeroshot.ipynb` to evaluate zero-shot performance on chemical reactions.
- For reproduction number inference from early outbreak curves, run: python r0_est.py


Each notebook is self-contained and includes example runs on provided datasets.
